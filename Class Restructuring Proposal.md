Teach LA's current web development class, taught through the React JavaScript framework, is one of our most popular classes. The class introduces students to web development fundamentals (HTML, CSS, JavaScript), as well as basic programming skills through JavaScript.
Lessons are delivered with weekly synchronous slides presentations and follow-along Replit exercises to solidify concepts.

A common piece of feedback received from students throughout the class was that instruction was too fast, and that students desired more long-form assignments instead of short exercises.

To address these concerns, this class restructuring would slow down the pace of new concepts by devoting more time to topics briefly covered by the original class material, introduce more long-form assignments, and shorten existing exercises.

## Course Objectives
- Students foster an appreciation for programming and computer science, hopefully beyond simply their application in web development
- Students gain familiarity with JavaScript language syntax
- Students gain proficiency with JavaScript's built-in methods and confidence to research language features independently
- Students gain an understanding how HTML is used to define a page's structure
- Students gain familiarity with common HTML elements: `<div>`, `<p>`, `<input>`, `<script>`, `<style>`
- Students learn to manipulate HTML/CSS pages using the Document Object Model
- Students understand how CSS is used to style a page; how styles are inherited and cascade
- Students gain familiarity with a component-focused framework, and understand how breaking pages into components makes creating complex, reactive applications simpler
- Students learn to create their own components with state and custom properties
