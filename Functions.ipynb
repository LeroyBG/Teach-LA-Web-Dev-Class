    "## Recap: Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops allow us to run a block of code repeatedly. The `while` loop checks a condition, and if the condition is true, executes its body. The `for` loop is syntactic sugar for a while loop that is more readable and less error prone.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, `while` loops are used to do something until a condition is false. `for` loops are primarily useful when the total number of iterations is known when the loop starts (e.g. iterating through a string with known length, printing 10 stars to the screen).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercise 1**: `for` vs. `while` loop.  \n",
    "Double-click the cell below and write the type of loop you'd use \"for\" or \"while,\" in the given situation. You don't actually have to write the loop code.  "
